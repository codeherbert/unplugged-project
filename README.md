# Unplugged - *website project*

A sample website built for learning responsive development and the use of media queries. It is created to be fully responsive with phones,
tablets, and desktops.  

## General info

The purpose of this project was to learn the critical skill of responsive web development! It taught me how to use media queries to 
accommodate different devices from users.  It also includes a navigation bar to move between three pages: the *Home* page, *About Us* page, and *FAQ's* page.  There
is a sidebar to represent accessing additional information. The *About Us* page also has an embedded map as well.
I was able to create a navigation menu that changed depending on the device. I also learned with the embedded map to make it 
responsive as well.  There was plenty of practice with HTML and CSS along the way.

My motivation in completing this sample website was to learn not just the structure of websites, but to learn the mobile-first approach. 
It drives home the necessity in making websites responsive with today's devices.  I'm excited to apply responsive development to future 
projects.  This was created before learning Flexbox.  Later projects will implement Flexbox, to speed up the layout process
even more.
